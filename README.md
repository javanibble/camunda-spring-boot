## Pre-Requisites
The following is required to run the Spring Boot example:
* [curl](https://www.javanibble.com/how-to-install-curl-on-macos-using-homebrew/)
* jq
* [maven](https://www.javanibble.com/how-to-install-maven-on-macos-using-homebrew/)

## Compile & Run The Example
### 1. Compile the application
Use the following command to compile the Spring Boot application making use of maven:

```shell
$ mvn clean install
```

### 2. Run the application
After you have successfully built the Camunda BPM Spring Boot application, the compiled artifact can be found in the
target directory. Use the following command to start the Camunda BPM Spring Boot Application.

```shell
$ maven spring-boot:run
```

### 3. Execute the example
After the application has started, run the following command in another terminal:

**Run the command: Start Process Instance**

The following command instantiates a new instance of the `personal-message` process and pass the process variable called
`personal-message` with a value of `Hello World !!!` to the process engine as part of the request body.

```shell
$ ./start_process_scenario_01.sh
```
The script performs the following commands:
```shell
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/engine-rest/process-definition/key/personal-message/start' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{
     "variables": {
         "personal-message": {
             "value": "Hello World !!!",
             "type": "String"
        }
    }
}'
```
